# Mixer
Mixer plugin for Nukkit and Bukkit


# Building
To build, run `gradle shadowJar`. You also have to add `spigot-1.9.jar`, `spigot-1.9.4.jar`, `spigot-1.10.2.jar`, `spigot-1.11.2.jar` and `spigot-1.12.2.jar` to the `/libs` folder.
The output is in the `/build/jars` folder.
The first build might take a while due to Forge.

# Running  
A precompiled jar is availible [at releases](https://github.com/funniray/Mixer/releases)
