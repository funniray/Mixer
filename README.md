# Mixer
Mixer plugin for Nukkit (Broken until rewrite comes out), Bukkit, Sponge and Forge


# Building
To build, run `gradle shadowJar`. You also have to add `spigot-1.9.jar`, `spigot-1.9.4.jar`, `spigot-1.10.2.jar`, `spigot-1.11.2.jar` and `spigot-1.12.2.jar` to the `/libs` folder.  
The output is in the `/build/jars` folder.  
You also have to add a gradle.properties file. [Blank file](https://github.com/funniray/Mixer/raw/5ec6556a4b96fc10c2d6f6fae5f71ea9ceed0047/gradle.properties)  
The first build might take a while due to Forge.  
  
# Running  
A precompiled jar is availible [at releases](https://github.com/funniray/Mixer/releases)
